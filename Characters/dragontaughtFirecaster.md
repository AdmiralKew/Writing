**Elly** has copper colored hair that is done in a braid that lies to one side, the other side hanging free and loose. A few locks fall over her forehead. Her brown eyes have a gentle set that compliments her delicate, freckled features, but shine with an inner fire like smoldering coals ready to ignite. 

A flame colored scarf wraps around her neck, the tassled ends of which falling to about knee-length. The rest of her clothes are a yellow bikini, silk arm sleeves, and a brown miniskirt held in place by a belt with attached pouches. Her feet are protected blue and white boots that flare out at the ankle.

Her familiar is a pale-blue squirrel-like creature with a darker blue stripe that runs down its back.

She is gentle with a good sense of people, and is highly protective of the ones she considers family. She will not hesitate to defend them with all of her strenth and powers, which are awesome to behold. She can summon flame powerful enough to melt even the scales of dragons, and strike hard enough to shatter those very same scales.
