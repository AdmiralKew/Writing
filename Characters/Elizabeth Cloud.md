#The Bright Angel, Elizabeth, A Character Description for a Close Friend
###Whitehat Hacker, Righteous Rebel, Light of the Deepnet

#####**From the diary of Soroku Yamato:**

It is a cold day in the Little Nihon Megadistrict and the breezes are blowing sakura petals over Ishida River, but the sky is clear and I am blessed with a spectacular view of Astrid and its system as the gas giant rises over the horizon. I am sipping coffee outside of the *Cafe de la Sol* as I wait for my contact and friend. She is known to many as **The Bright Angel**. I know her as Elizabeth Cloud.

Minutes later, I hear the sound of a motorcycle approaching and I turn my head just in time to see a woman in a white coat arrive on a blue and white motorcycle. Embroidered on the back of the woman's coat is symbol **The Bright Angel** has adopted as her personal emblem: a pair of blue wings. I think nothing of it. Many of the youth in the area has taken to idolizing her, even copying her manner of dress to the last detail.

The woman lowers her hood as she approaches, revealing her blue-streaked white hair and mismatched eyes. They are a ruby set against obsidian and a sapphire set against ivory. I can pick the click of her heeled boots on the cobblestone pavement out of the ambience of a busy cafe as she walks over to the seat across mine. She slumps into it and grins easily. Her boots are the only thing she wears that are not white or blue, at least taking from my knowledge.

It is indeed her.

She tells me of her exploits today, about how she has struck another victory against the forces of tyranny over hot chocolate and churros. Her voice is clear, and her laughter is light and easy but even that does not dilute the sheer passion and determination that lies underneath. Loud music filters from the headphones that she wears around her neck. Once I had asked why did she not simply wear them, and my reply was laughter.

This laughing, carefree woman before me has contributed to the service of justice in ways I cannot imagine. She moves through cyberspace as easily as koi glide in the water of a calm pond, seeking out what is wrong and setting it right.
